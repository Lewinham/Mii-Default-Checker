# Mii-Default-Checker
Hello! Do you want to improve at Mii-making? One of the first things you can do is play with all the different sliders in order to make unique characters. All too often, people barely use the sliders, resulting in very similar-looking and boring designs. Those of us in the Miitopia Discord server have affectionately referred to these kinds of designs as "Default Moments." This here is a program I have written that will tell you whether or not a mii is a "Default Moment."

# What You Need & How to Use:
### 1. You need to download Python 3 and an IDE (PyCharm, Google Colaboratory, etc.)
### 2. Copy and paste the code below exactly as it is into the IDE.
### 3. Run the program and input the slider values for your mii.
###### The default position of any slider corresponds to a value of 0. 
###### The number of ticks away from the default position of the slider is the value you will input.
### 4. The program will return a Default Moment Index and tell you whether or not your mii is a "Default Moment."
###### An index of 0 corresponds to the default male/female mii.
###### The higher the index, the less of a default moment your mii is.
