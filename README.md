# Mii-Default-Checker
Hello! This here is a program I have written that can determine whether or not a mii is a "Default Moment."  
_________________________________________
# What You Need & How to Use:
### 1. You need to download Python 3 and an IDE (PyCharm, Google Colaboratory, etc.)
### 2. Copy and paste the code below exactly as it is into the IDE.
### 3. Run the program and input the slider values for your mii.
###### The default position of any slider corresponds to a value of 0. 
###### The number of ticks away from the default position of the slider is the value you will input.
### 4. The program will return a Default Moment Index and tell you whether or not your mii is a "Default Moment."
###### An index of 0 corresponds to the default male/female mii.
###### The higher the index, the less of a default moment your mii is.
